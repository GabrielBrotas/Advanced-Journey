# SOLID

SOLID are five principles of object-oriented programming that facilitate software development, making them easy to maintain and extend. These principles can be applied to any OOP language.

These principles help the programmer write cleaner code, separating responsibilities, reducing couplings, facilitating refactoring, and encouraging code reuse.

- [S ⇒ SRC ⇒ Single Responsibility Principle](/SOLID/single-responsability)
- [O ⇒ OCP ⇒ Open-closed Principle](/SOLID/open-closed)
- [L ⇒ LSP ⇒ Liskov Substitution Principle](/SOLID/liskov-substitution)
- [I ⇒ ISP ⇒ Interface Segregation Principle](/SOLID/interface-segregation)
- [D ⇒ DIP ⇒ Dependency Inversion Principle](/SOLID/dependency-inversion)
